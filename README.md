About the Journal:
We hope to submit this research paper (8 pages) to the Communications of the ACM as a contributed article (https://cacm.acm.org/about-communications/author-center/author-guidelines#2.3.4). As in the workshop, we intend to take a broad view of specification, concentrating on top-level requirements including but not limited to functionality, safety, security, trustworthiness and other non-functional properties. We would also like to leave the discussion on formalisation of these specifications to a future paper, when our understanding of what is required to specify trustworthiness will be more mature.

***Due Date:
Please could you push your edited source files to the repository by October 31st? Also, I would appreciate if you could email me (dhaminda.abeywickrama@bristol.ac.uk) when you have uploaded the files. We hope to edit the paper from Nov 1-5.
